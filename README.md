# Pong-Study

This Project is a reimagined version of the classic Pong game developed in Unity with C#. This project serves as a study base for applying software architecture concepts and design patterns in games.

## Description

This project features both single-player and cooperative modes with dynamic rule changes that enhance gameplay. In cooperative mode, two players work together to achieve high scores. After scoring, the game introduces new rules such as changing ball speed, adding multiple balls, altering game physics, or rotating the map and others features.
